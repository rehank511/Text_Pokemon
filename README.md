# Text_Pokemon

Programmed a very basic console based pokemon, with few predifned characters to choose from and a random enemy is chosen, for thr fight it self using a loop graphics with text are shown while at the backend the program is trying to depict the winner using their stats and randomly hitting each other. This repeats itself with some more characters.
This was the first project we did in C++.
